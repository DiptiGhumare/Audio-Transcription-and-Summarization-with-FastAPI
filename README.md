Problem Statement : 
Audio Transcription and Summarization with FastAPI

Objective:
You are tasked with developing a system that handles audio files by transcribing them, summarizing the
content, extracting timestamps, and saving the results locally. Additionally, you will implement a FastAPI
server to handle endpoints for this process.

Requirements:
1. Transcription: Utilize the whisper-large-v3 model from OpenAI to transcribe the audio file
provided. Implement this using asynchronous endpoints in FastAPI to handle potentially large
audio files efficiently. Ensure the transcription handles common audio formats such
as .wav, .mp3, etc.

2. Summarization: Use any suitable summarization model to generate a concise summary of the
transcribed text from the audio file.

3. Timestamp Extraction: Extract timestamps or time intervals from the audio file where key
events or changes in content occur. These timestamps should be correlated with the
transcription.

Implementation:

Whisper : 
Whisper is an advanced automatic speech recognition (ASR) model developed by OpenAI. It is designed to transcribe spoken language into written text with exceptional accuracy. Whisper excels at handling a variety of accents, background noises, and multiple languages, making it a robust tool for diverse transcription needs.

Audio Transcription :
Audio transcription is the process of converting spoken words from an audio file into written text. This process is useful for generating meeting notes, creating subtitles for videos, enhancing accessibility for the hearing impaired, and many other applications.

Real-Time Use Case: Sentiment Analysis
Unique Real-World Application: Sentiment Analysis of Transcriptions
This project not only transcribes and summarizes audio files but can also be extended for sentiment analysis of the transcriptions. Imagine you have a large number of customer service calls, and you need to analyze the overall sentiment of these conversations to improve customer satisfaction.

Use Case: Customer Feedback Analysis

Step 1: Transcription: Upload audio recordings of customer service calls.
Step 2: Summarization: Get a concise summary of each call.
Step 3: Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the transcriptions to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the conversations.
By integrating sentiment analysis, you can:

Improve Customer Service: Identify areas where customer service can be improved based on sentiment trends.
Track Performance: Monitor the effectiveness of customer service representatives.
Enhance Customer Experience: Use insights to enhance overall customer satisfaction.   

Project Description
This project offers a powerful API for converting audio files into text and summarizing the resulting transcriptions. By using cutting-edge machine learning models from the transformers library, the API provides reliable and efficient audio processing capabilities.

Key Points
Transcription Service: Upload an audio file and receive a text transcription.
Summarization Service: Obtain a concise summary of the transcribed text.
Timestamp Service: Get word-level timestamps for the transcription, detailing when each word was spoken.

Requirements
Python 3.8+
FastAPI
Uvicorn
transformers
pydantic
shutil
ffmpeg (required for audio processing)


Set Up a Virtual Environment

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  

Install Required Packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Install FFmpeg:
Follow the instructions on the FFmpeg download page to install FFmpeg and add it to your system's PATH.  

Running the Application 
Start the FastAPI Server:
uvicorn main:app --reload

Access API Documentation:
Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to view the interactive API documentation.

Upload and Process an Audio File:

File Descriptions
main.py
The main entry point for the FastAPI application. It defines the API endpoints, handles file uploads, and orchestrates the transcription and summarization processes.

data.py
Includes functions to save transcriptions, summaries, and timestamps to the file system. This ensures that results are stored securely and can be accessed later.

transcription.py
Implements the transcription functionality using a pre-trained ASR model from the transformers library. It reads audio files and outputs the transcribed text along with word-level timestamps.

summarization.py
Uses a summarization model from the transformers library to create brief summaries of the transcribed text. This allows users to quickly grasp the main points of the transcription.

requirements.txt
Lists all the dependencies required for the project, including FastAPI for the web framework, Uvicorn as the ASGI server, and transformers for the machine learning models.

This API offers a streamlined and efficient way to transcribe and summarize audio files, utilizing advanced machine learning models to deliver accurate and timely results.
