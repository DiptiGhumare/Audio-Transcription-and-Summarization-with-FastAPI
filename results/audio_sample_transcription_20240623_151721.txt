 One powerful application of audio transcription is sentiment analysis. By transcribing customer service calls, social media videos, or any other spoken content, businesses can analyze the sentiments expressed in the audio. This analysis helps companies understand customer emotions, identify trends, improve customer service, and make informed decisions based on real-time feedback.
